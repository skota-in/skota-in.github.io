# Deploying Angular Application to AWS Amplify

*Published on February 5, 2024*

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying an Angular application to AWS Amplify.

## Prerequisites

1. An AWS account
2. Node.js and npm installed
3. Angular CLI installed (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
4. AWS CLI installed and configured
5. Git installed and configured

## Step 1: Create an Angular Application

If you don't have an existing Angular application, create one:

```bash
ng new my-angular-app
cd my-angular-app
```

## Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

If not already initialized:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Set Up AWS Amplify

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to AWS Amplify
3. Click "New app" â†’ "Host web app"
4. Select "GitHub" as your repository service
5. Authorize AWS Amplify to access your GitHub account
6. Select your repository and branch
7. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist/<your-app-name>`
8. Review and deploy

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

If your application requires environment variables:

1. In the Amplify Console, go to your app
2. Navigate to "Environment variables"
3. Add your environment variables
4. Save and redeploy

## Step 6: Custom Domain (Optional)

To add a custom domain:

1. In the Amplify Console, go to "Domain management"
2. Click "Add domain"
3. Follow the instructions to verify domain ownership
4. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider

## Step 7: Continuous Deployment

AWS Amplify automatically sets up continuous deployment:
- Any push to your main branch will trigger a new deployment
- Pull requests will create preview deployments

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment.ts for development
   - Use environment.prod.ts for production
   - Configure different environment variables in Amplify

2. **Build Optimization**
   - Enable production mode: `ng build --prod`
   - Use Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation
   - Enable build optimization

3. **Caching**
   - Configure appropriate cache headers
   - Use AWS CloudFront for CDN

4. **Security**
   - Enable HTTPS
   - Configure appropriate CORS settings
   - Use AWS WAF if needed

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check build logs in Amplify Console
   - Verify node version compatibility
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

2. **Deployment Issues**
   - Verify build settings
   - Check environment variables
   - Ensure proper output directory configuration

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Enable compression
   - Configure proper cache headers
   - Optimize assets
