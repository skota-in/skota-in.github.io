## What is Multi-threading?

Multi-threading is a programming concept that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process. In Java, each thread represents an independent path of execution.

### Key Benefits:
- Improved application responsiveness
- Better CPU utilization
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Asynchronous operations
- Resource sharing
- Simplified modeling of concurrent activities

### Challenges:
- Thread safety
- Deadlocks
- Race conditions
- Resource contention
- Debugging complexity

## Thread Basics

### Thread Lifecycle
A thread in Java goes through various states during its lifecycle:
- NEW: Thread created but not started
- RUNNABLE: Thread is executing
- BLOCKED: Thread waiting for a monitor lock
- WAITING: Thread waiting indefinitely
- TIMED_WAITING: Thread waiting for a specified time
- TERMINATED: Thread has completed execution

### Thread Properties:
- Priority levels (1-10)
- Daemon status
- Thread group
- Stack size
- Name and ID

## Creating Threads

### 1. Extending Thread Class
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

// Usage
MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();
```

### 2. Implementing Runnable Interface
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable is running");
    }
}

// Usage
Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
thread.start();
```

### 3. Using Lambda Expressions (Java 8+)
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Thread running with lambda");
});
thread.start();
```

## Thread Synchronization

### Using synchronized keyword
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    
    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Using ReentrantLock
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class Counter {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int count = 0;
    
    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

### Synchronization Techniques:
- Method synchronization
- Block synchronization
- Lock objects
- Atomic variables
- Volatile keyword

## Thread Communication

### Using wait() and notify()
```java
class Message {
    private String message;
    private boolean empty = true;

    public synchronized String read() {
        while (empty) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
        empty = true;
        notifyAll();
        return message;
    }

    public synchronized void write(String message) {
        while (!empty) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
        empty = false;
        this.message = message;
        notifyAll();
    }
}
```

### Communication Patterns:
- Producer-Consumer
- Reader-Writer
- Barrier synchronization
- Countdown latch
- Cyclic barrier

## Thread Pooling

### Using ExecutorService
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread("" + i);
            executor.execute(worker);
        }
        
        executor.shutdown();
        while (!executor.isTerminated()) {}
        System.out.println("Finished all threads");
    }
}
```

### Thread Pool Types:
- Fixed thread pool
- Cached thread pool
- Scheduled thread pool
- Single thread executor
- Work stealing pool

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. Thread Joining
```java
Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Thread 1 running");
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
});

Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        t1.join(); // Wait for t1 to complete
        System.out.println("Thread 2 running after Thread 1");
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
});

t1.start();
t2.start();
```

### 2. Thread Interruption
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            System.out.println("Thread running");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            break;
        }
    }
});

thread.start();
// Later...
thread.interrupt();
```

### 3. Thread Local Variables
```java
class ThreadLocalExample {
    private static final ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        threadLocal.set(1);
        System.out.println(threadLocal.get()); // 1
    }
}
```

### 4. CompletableFuture
```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    // Long running task
    return "Result";
}).thenAccept(result -> {
    System.out.println("Got result: " + result);
});
```
